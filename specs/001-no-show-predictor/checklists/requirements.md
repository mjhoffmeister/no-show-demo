# Specification Quality Checklist: Medical Appointment No-Show Predictor

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning  
**Created**: 2026-01-28  
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification validated and ready for `/speckit.plan` phase
- All user stories are independently testable as per template requirements
- Assumptions clearly document out-of-scope items (HIPAA, EHR integration, multi-user)
- ML model validation criteria (70% accuracy) aligns with demo purposes while maintaining scientific rigor
